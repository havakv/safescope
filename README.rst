Python package for preventing use of variables from enclosing scope.


* Free software: BSD license
* Documentation: https://safescope.readthedocs.io.

Install
--------

::

    pip install safescope


Features
--------

This is a package that can be used for preventing functions from using global variables,
or variables from enclosing scopes.
The functionality is only meant for use in notebooks, and not real code.
Arguably, use of this package incurrage bad programming habits...

Quickstart:
::

    from safescope import assert_local_vars

    a = 0

    @assert_local_vars
    def foo():
        b = 5
        return a + b

This should raise an error explaining that a is not in the function scope.
